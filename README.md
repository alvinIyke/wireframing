# Wireframing
## Definition
A wireframe is simply a basic outline of a digital experience.
## Importance
Wireframes help you to
+ Visualize ideas
+ Communicate them clearly
+ Iterate quickly
## Key Elements Found in a Wireframe
+ Layout structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page. They form the
  foundation of any wireframe.
+ Navigation elements: These components create the roadmap users follow through your
  interface. They include primary menus, search bars and footer links.
+ Content Placement: Indicates where text, images,and other content will be positioned.
  When done properly it avoids cramping the design.
+ Interactive elements: These elements are crucial for user engagement. They include buttons,
  form fields, checkboxes and dropdown menus. Wireframes show the placement and hierachy of these elements.
+ Functionality: Whilst this may not be visible at this point, however they provide context about behaviors,
  interactions or technical requirements.
## Types of Wireframes
+ Low-fidelity wireframes.
+ High-fidelity wireframes.
### Differences between Low-fidelity and High-fidelity wireframes
+ Low-fidelity wireframes are the most basic type of wireframes. They are created with simple shapes, boxes and
  placeholder text. These rough sketches focus purely on layout and content structure without visual styling details.
+ High-fidelity wireframes contain detailed layouts with precise measurements, actual content and sometimes basic
  interactions.
